A Pathfinding Algorithm*

This project implements the A* (A-star) pathfinding algorithm, which is widely used for finding the shortest path between two points in a grid, considering both distance and obstacles. The algorithm combines elements of Dijkstra's algorithm and greedy best-first search to efficiently find an optimal solution.
